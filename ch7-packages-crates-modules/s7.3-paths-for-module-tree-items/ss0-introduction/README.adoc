:source-highlighter: highlight.js

From the previous subsection...

In the generated code, change main.rs to lib.rs.

Add this to it:

[source,rust]
----
mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}

        fn seat_at_table() {}
    }

    mod serving {
        fn take_order() {}

        fn serve_order() {}

        fn take_payment() {}
    }
}
----

We won't deal with the specifics of the functions.
This code is valid apart from the functions never being used.

Module items are _private_ by default.
The initial commit has an error in that the add_to_waitlist function
is private.
To make it accessible, it is necessary to

- make the module it is in public
- make it public

Use the `pub` keyword.
