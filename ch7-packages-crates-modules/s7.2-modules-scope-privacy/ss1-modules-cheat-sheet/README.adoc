= Modules Cheat Sheet
:source-highlighter: highlight.js

- Start from crate root
- Declare modules in the crate root
- Declare Submodules in files other than the crate root
- Use paths to code in modules
- Use pub mod to make a module public
- `use` shortens code paths

Here's what it looks like for this example:
----
backyard
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    ├── garden
    │   └── vegetables.rs
    ├── garden.rs
    └── main.rs
----

Initially copy this code into `src/main.rs`:

[source,rust]
----
use crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus;

pub mod garden;

fn main() {
    let plant = Asparagus {};
    println!("I'm growing {plant:?}!");
}
----
The `pub mod garden` says to include from `src/garden.rs`, which does 
not exist yet.
So the editor shows an error and the compilation would fail.

We therefore add the `garden` file containing
[source,rust]
----
pub mod vegetables;
----

This requires `src/vegetables.rs` so we add that to, containing

[source,rust]
----
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Asparagus {}
----

With these changes the main program runs successfully.
