= Packages and Crates
:source-highlighter: highlight.js

Crates are _binary_ or _library_.
These produce a inary with a `main` and a library for sharing code, 
respectively.

_Crate root_ is a special file in a crate, from which the compiler 
starts.

A _package_ is a bundle of one or more crates.
It contains a `Cargo.toml` file that says how to build.

[source,toml]
----
[package]
name = "ss1-defining-an-enum"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
----
Create a package:

[source, shell]
----
$ cargo new my-project
     Created binary (application) `my-project` package
$ ls my-project
Cargo.toml
src
$ ls my-project/src
main.rs
----

Convention: 

- src/main.rs is crate root for binary crate with same name 
as the package.
- src/lib.rs is crate root for a library crate with same name as the 
package

_A package can have multiple binary crates by placing files in the 
src/bin directory: each file will be a separate binary crate._
