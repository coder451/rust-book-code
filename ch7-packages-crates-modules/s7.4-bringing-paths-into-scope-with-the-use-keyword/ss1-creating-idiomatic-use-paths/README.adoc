= Creating Idiomatic Use Paths
:source-highlighter: highlight.js

Do not `use` a function then refer to it by its bare name.
Doing that would conceal the fact that it comes from a different
module.
Instead, `use` its parent module, and then qualify its name with the 
name of its parent.

The opposite convention is used for structs and enums.
That is, the complete path is specified in the `use`.

[source,rust]
----
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert(1, 2);
}
----

Of course, if two items have the same name, they can't both be brought
into the same scope with complete `use` paths. 
One common example is a `Result` struct provided by many libraries:

[source,rust]
----
use std::fmt;
use std::io;

fn function1() -> fmt::Result {
    // --snip--
}

fn function2() -> io::Result<()> {
    // --snip--
}
