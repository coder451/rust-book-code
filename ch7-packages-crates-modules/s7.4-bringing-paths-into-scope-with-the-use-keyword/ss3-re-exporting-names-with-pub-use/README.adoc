= Re-exporting a name with pub use

The keyword combination `pub use` provides a way to provide a
different interface to your code than the one based on its internal
structure.

For example, this can be used to avoid clients of a crate having to
be aware of some internal level of organizatio in your code.

In the restaurant example, `add_to-waitlist` is in the module
`front_of_house::hosting`. 
But looking at it from the point of view of the customer,
who sees only the front of house, we would prefer `eat_at_restaurant`
to not have to know about the front/back distinction.

To allow this, we can add a re-export with `pub use`.

[source,rust]
----
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
----

Now the customer view is easier to understand.
