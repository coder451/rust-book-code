`use` applies to the scope in which it is located, not all subsequent 
scopes.

mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

mod customer {
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }
}

In this code, the `use` declaration is not available inside the
`customer` module.
