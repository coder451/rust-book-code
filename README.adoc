== Path Lengths

The path lengths in this repository cause some of the 
intermediate files to have path lengths greater than the standard 
Windows limit of 260. 
Longer paths result in failures where a linker output file cannot be 
opened.
You won't notice this until you are importing a crate in a deep folder.
Then the additional intermediate files that are built have such 
long file paths.

I first saw this in chapter 7, section 7.4, in the section on using 
external packages.
The error messages do not make the problem obvious.
Searching in rust forums is not much help because this is on Windows 
and related to the Windows linker. 
It does come from some Rust behavior: the creation of intermediate
files. 
But that is a secondary cause.
So you have to recognize this yourself.

Or, just keep the path lengths short.
