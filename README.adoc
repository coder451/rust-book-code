= Rust Book Code

Note: the path lengths in this repository get up to where some of the 
intermediate files have path lengths greater than the standard 
Windows limit of 260. 
Longer paths result in failures where an output file cannot be opened.
You won't notice this until you are importing a crate in s deep folder.
Then the additional intermediate files that are built have such 
longer file paths.

I first saw this in chapter 7, section 7.4, in the section on using 
external packages.

Keep the path lengths short enough and you'll avoid this.
