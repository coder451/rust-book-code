= Fibonacci Calculator

Calculates a list of fibonacci numbers requested by order - the nth
numbers. 
These start with 0th as 0, 1st as 1, 2nd as 1, 3rd as 2, 
4th as 3 and so on. 
A 64-bit unsigned integer is used, allowing up to
the 93rd Fibonacci number to be calculated.
The program is run with a list of desired N on the command line.
Optionally --verbose may be added to get more output.
The basic output is a list of requested orders with the corresponding 
members of the Fibonacci series, one per line.
For requested orders that are too large, that is indicated in the 
output.
