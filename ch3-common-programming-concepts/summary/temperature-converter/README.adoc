= Convert Temperature in Rust

My first Rust program from scratch.
Converts C to F and F to C.
Run as

----
prog-name value[ ][F|C]
----

or

----
prog-name
----

In the first case the conversion runs once. 
Examples of input are 10.1c, 10C, 10 c, 10 C, 
11f, 11 F, 11f, 11 F.
Negative values can be used.
The value for conversion is followed by the unit, with an
optional space or spaces separating the unit from the value.
In this case there is minimal output and the result is printed on
one line with no space between the value and the unit.

In the second case it runs in a loop, requesting input in the
format described above. 
There is more output in this case than in the single execution case.
End by inputting q instead of a temperature.
