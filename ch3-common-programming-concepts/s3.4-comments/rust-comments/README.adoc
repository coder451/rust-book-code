= Comments

A lib.rs for illustrating doc comments has been added.

Doc comments on consecutive lines are rendered without an
intervening line break. 
To avoid this behaviour, leave two trailing spaces at the end of any
line after which you need a break. 
This behaviour is based on 
https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#softbreak[this section of the Commonmark spec].

This is pretty bad behaviour in my opinion.

Doc comments may be _line_ `//!` or _block_ `/*! ... */`

Doc comments may be outer or inner.

An outer doc comment is applied to the next item after it.

An inner doc comment is applied to the previous item, in other words, 
the one it is inside.
