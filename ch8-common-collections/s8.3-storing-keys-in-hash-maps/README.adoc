== Storing keys in hash maps
:hide-uri-scheme:

`HashMap<K, V>` is a similar pattern to other languages.

It uses 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash[SipHash] 
as the hashing function.

Whereas cryptographic hashes are designed so that it is difficult for 
an attacker to find two messages with the same hash, SipHash is
designed to resist _hash flooding_ DoS attacks. 
It is an efficient _keyed hash function_.
SipHash guarantees that, having seen message _X~j~_ and
_SipHash(X~j~, k)_, an attacker who does not know the key _k_ cannot 
find any information about _k_ or _SipHash(Y, k)_ for any message 
they have not seen before.
