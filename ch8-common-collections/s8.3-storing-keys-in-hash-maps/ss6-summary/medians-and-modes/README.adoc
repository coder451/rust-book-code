= Medians and Modes

Given a list of integers, find the median and mode.

Begin with a function that takes a vector of integers
and computes median and mode.

* median: when sorted, the value in the middle position
* mode: the most frequent value

The function will return its answers in a struct Result.

Begin here:

[source,rust]
----
fn main() {
    println!("Medians and modes");
    let result = compute_stats();
    println!("{:?}", result);
}

#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Result {
    median: i64,
    mode: i64,
}

pub fn compute_stats() -> Result {
    Result{median: 0, mode: 0,}
}
