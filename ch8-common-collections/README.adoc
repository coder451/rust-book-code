= Common Collections
:source-highlighting: highlight.js

- Vector
- String
- Hash map

See 
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/index.html[the documentation].

There are four main categories:

- Sequences: vector, double-ended queue, linked list
- Maps: Hash map and tree map
- Sets: Hash set and tree set
- Others: binary heap

Collections provide _iterators_ to access their contents:

- iter
- iter_mut
- into_iter.

Iterators have _adapter methods_ like:
- map
- fold
- skip
- take
- rev.

The map containers have an `entry` API.

The standard containers are imported in the prelude.
There is no need to `use` anything to use them.

Generally, there is enough information available in the code so that
the contained type need not be set explicitly. See 8.1 ss2.
