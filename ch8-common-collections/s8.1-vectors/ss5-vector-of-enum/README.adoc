= Using an Enum to Store Multiple Types

Looking at this code:
[source,rust]
----
    enum SpreadsheetCell {
        Int(i32),
        Float(f64),
        Text(String),
    }

    let row = vec![
        SpreadsheetCell::Int(3),
        SpreadsheetCell::Text(String::from("blue")),
        SpreadsheetCell::Float(10.12),
    ];

    println!("{:?}", &row[0]);
    println!("{:?}", &row[1]);
    println!("{:?}", &row[2]);
----
This results in warnings like
....
warning: field `0` is never read
 --> src/main.rs:8:13
  |
8 |         Int(i32),
  |         --- ^^^
  |         |
  |         field in this variant
  |
  = note: `SpreadsheetCell` has a derived impl for the trait `Debug`, but this is intentionally ignored during dead code analysis
  = note: `#[warn(dead_code)]` on by default
help: consider changing the field to be of unit type to suppress this warning while preserving the field numbering, or remove the field
  |
8 |         Int(()),
  |             ~~
....

I expected the print to read the corresponding variant.
Why is there a warning?
