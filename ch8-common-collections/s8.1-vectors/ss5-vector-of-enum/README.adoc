= Using an Enum to Store Multiple Types

Looking at this code:
[source,rust]
----
    enum SpreadsheetCell {
        Int(i32),
        Float(f64),
        Text(String),
    }

    let row = vec![
        SpreadsheetCell::Int(3),
        SpreadsheetCell::Text(String::from("blue")),
        SpreadsheetCell::Float(10.12),
    ];

    println!("{:?}", &row[0]);
    println!("{:?}", &row[1]);
    println!("{:?}", &row[2]);
----
This results in warnings like
....
warning: field `0` is never read
 --> src/main.rs:8:13
  |
8 |         Int(i32),
  |         --- ^^^
  |         |
  |         field in this variant
  |
  = note: `SpreadsheetCell` has a derived impl for the trait `Debug`, but this is intentionally ignored during dead code analysis
  = note: `#[warn(dead_code)]` on by default
help: consider changing the field to be of unit type to suppress this warning while preserving the field numbering, or remove the field
  |
8 |         Int(()),
  |             ~~
....

I expected the print to read the corresponding variant.
There is no warning because the debug print is ignored in the dead code 
analysis.
To remove the warnings, use a match to access the details in a way that
provides explicit typing:
[source,rust]
----
    // This illustrates explicitly accessing the individual values from 
    // the enum
    let i = match row[0] {
        SpreadsheetCell::Int(i) => i,
        _ => -1
    };
    let f = match row[2] {
        SpreadsheetCell::Float(f) => f,
        _ => -1.0
    };
    let t = match &row[1] {
        SpreadsheetCell::Text(t) => String::from(t),
        _ => String::from("")
    };
