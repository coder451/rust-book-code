= Reading vector elements
:source-highlighter: highlight.js

There are two ways to access vector elements.

[source,rust]
----
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let does_not_exist = &v[100];
    let does_not_exist = v.get(100);
----

The first call will panic.
The second returns an `Option::None`.

[source,rust]
----
    let mut w = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let w0 = &w[0];
    w.push(6);
    println!("{w0}");
----

results in

----
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `w` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable

Looked at the "simplified" version of Vec in The Rustonomicon.
Still seems pretty complicated at this stage.
